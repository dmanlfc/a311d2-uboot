      4.    TERM AND TERMINATION.

            4.1   Term and Termination. This Agreement shall become effective on the
date first set forth above and shall remain in effect perpetually unless terminated as provided
below. If Licensee defaults in a material obligation under this Agreement, and if the default is

            4.2   Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, the
rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate;
provided, however, that sublicenses of the Software or Derivative Works in Object Code format,

6 and 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

      S.    CONFIDENTIALITY.

            5.1   Existing NDA (if Applicable). If Amlogic and Licensee already have put
in place a non-disclosure agreement that would protect communications made under this
Agreement (the "NDA"), then all such communications shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of such NDA, which the parties acknowledge is in full force and effect. The parties
agree that the Software, Object Code, Source and any accompanying documentation will be
considered Confidential Information under the NDA. In the event of a conflict between the
terms of this Agreement and the terms of the NDA, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.

            5.2   Obligations if No NDA Exists. If no NDA exists, then the following
terms shall apply: Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Software, Object Code, Source
Code, any accompanying documentation, and any other information (if such other information is
identified as confidential or should be recognized as confidential under the circumstances)
provided to Licensee by Amlogic hereunder (collectively, "Confidential Information") constitute
the confidential and proprietary information of Amlogic, and that Licensee's protection thereof is
an essential condition to Licensee's use and possession of the Confidential Information.
Licensee shall retain all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to any
third party or use it in any way except as permitted by this Agreement without Amlogic's express
written consent. Licensee will exercise at least the same amount of diligence in preserving the
secrecy of the Confidential Information as it uses in preserving the secrecy ofits own most
valuable confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable diligence. The
prohibitions contained in this Section 5.2 preclude dissemination of Confidential Information to
Licensee's subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors or subcontractors, except in the event of a
permitted assignment pursuant to Section 7.1. Information shall not be considered Confidential
Information if and to the extent that it: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed
or has entered the public domain through no fault of Licensee; (ii) was known to Licensee,
without restriction, at the time of disclosure as proven by the files of Licensee in existence at the
time of disclosure; or (iii) becomes known to Licensee, without restriction, from a source other
than Amlogic without breach of this Agreement by Licensee and otherwise not in violation of
Amlogic's rights. Because of the unique and valuable nature of the Confidential Information,
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Amlogic will suffer irreparable harm in the event that the
Licensee fails to comply with any of its obligations herein and that monetary damages will be
inadequate to compensate Amlogic for such breach. Accordingly, Amlogic and Licensee agree
that Amlogic will, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, be entitled to
obtain injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

            5.3   Source Code Protection. Licensee shall not under any circumstances
copy, duplicate or otherwise reproduce the Source Code in any manner except as provided
herein. Licensee is granted the right to make one (1) archival or backup copy ofthe Source
Code, which shall be marked as an archival copy and as the confidential and proprietary property
of Amlogic to which access is restricted. Licensee agrees to inform all employees and


                                       5

contractors who are given access by Licensee to the Software, including the Source Code, the
Object Code, or any accompanying documentation, that such materials are confidential and trade
secrets of Amlogic licensed to Licensee as such.

      6.    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      EXCEPT FOR A BREACH BY LICENSEE OF SECTION 2 (LICENSE GRANT;
OWNERSHIP) OR A BREACH BY EITHER PARTY OF SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY),
IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSEE, AMLOGIC OR ANY OF AMLOGIC'S LICENSORS
HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER WISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, EVEN IF    SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.       THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL
APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
LIMITED REMEDY.

IN NO EVENT SHALL AMLOGIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE
GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER
TO AMLOGIC HEREUNDER.

benefit ofthe parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however that
Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligation hereunder, directly or

any such attempted assignment shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may

            7.3   Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws
of California without regard to any conflict-of-Iaws rules, and the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded. The sole jurisdiction and
venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the state and federal courts located
in the County of Santa Clara, California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and

                                       6

            7.4   Severability. All terms and provisions ofthis Agreement shall, if
possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any term or
provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or
unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be
affected if the illegal or unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent ofthis
Agreement. If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the intent of the parties to
this Agreement, this Agreement shall become terminated.

            7.5   Equitable Relief. Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Amlogic that may be difficult
to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, Licensee agrees that
Amlogic shall have the right to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations
under the Agreement in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.

            7.6   Export Regulations. Licensee agrees and warrants that it shall comply, at
its own expense, with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all export laws, restrictions,
national security controls and regulations of the United States and any applicable foreign agency
or authority. Licensee shall not export or re-export, or authorize the export or re-export of the
Software or any other product, technology, or information that Licensee obtains or learns
hereunder, or any copy or direct product thereof, in violation of any of such laws, restrictions, or
regulations or without any license or approval required thereunder. Any and all obligations of
Amlogic to provide Software or any media in which the Software is contained shall be subject in
all respects to such laws, restrictions, and regulations.

            7.7   Waiver. The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or default.

            7.8   Entire Agreement. This Agreement, along with any associated Software
Description Forms, sets forth the entire Agreement between the parties and supersedes any and
all prior proposals, agreements and representations between them, whether written or oral. This
Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in writing. In the event of
a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Software Description Form,
the term of the Software Description Form will prevail.
